√ Successfully created initial AWS cloud resources for deployments.
√ Initialized provider successfully.
Initialized your environment successfully.

Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!

Some next steps:
"amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
"amplify add <category>" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify console" to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify publish" to deploy everything
````

Once project created,
we can notice that we have new folder under our root directory called _amplify_
and new aws config file src/aws-exports.js
````javascript
/* eslint-disable */
// WARNING: DO NOT EDIT. This file is automatically generated by AWS Amplify. It will be overwritten.

const awsmobile = {
    "aws_project_region": "us-east-1"
};


export default awsmobile;
````
_This file will update each feature we will add to the project_

#### Add amplify to code

Install aws-amplify library
````
npm i aws-amplify
````
Import aws-exports configuration and init Amplify

src/index.js
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
// Amplify
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import config from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(config);

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
