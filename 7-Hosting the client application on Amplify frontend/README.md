_AWS Amplify offers a fully managed service for deploying and hosting static web applications, with built-in CI/CD workflows that accelerate your application release cycle. Simply connect your application's code repository in the Amplify console, and changes to your front end and backend are deployed in a single workflow on every code commit._
