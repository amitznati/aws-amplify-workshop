? Please provide bucket name: awsamplifyworkshopxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
? Who should have access: Auth and guest users
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users? create/update, read, delete
? What kind of access do you want for Guest users? read
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket? No
Auth configuration is required to allow unauthenticated users, but it is not configured properly.
Successfully updated auth resource locally.
Successfully added resource awsworkshopresource locally

If a user is part of a user pool group, run "amplify update storage" to enable IAM group policies for CRUD operations
Some next steps:
"amplify push" builds all of your local backend resources and provisions them in the cloud
"amplify publish" builds all of your local backend and front-end resources (if you added hosting category) and provisions them in the cloud

Add postImage field to Post model
````graphql
type Post
@model
@auth(rules: [
  {allow: public, operations: [read]},
  {allow: owner, ownerField: "username"},
])
@key(name: "postByUsername", fields: ["username"], queryField: "postByUsername")
{
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  body: String
  username: String
  postImage: String
}

### Using Storage
import Storage
```javascript
import {Storage} from 'aws-amplify';
```
Updating CreatePost with new image field

Add new State 
```javascript
const [image, setImage] = React.useState(null);
// on image change handler
const onImageChange = ({target: {validity, files: [file]}}) =>
    validity.valid && setImage(file);
```
Add new image input to the form
```javascript
<form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
  <div>
    ...
    <input type="file" name="postImage" accept="image/*" onChange={onImageChange} />
    ...
  </div>
</form>
```

Change onSubmit to handle the image upload
```javascript
const onSubmit = e => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (!(newPost.title && newPost.body)) return;
  API.graphql({
    query: createPost,
    variables: {input: newPost},
    authMode: 'AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS'
  }).then(res => {
    const postId = res.data.createPost.id;
    // uploading the image to S3 Bucket
    Storage.put(
      `${postId}.${image.name.split('.').pop()}`,
      image,
      {contentType: image.type})
      .then(storageRes => {
        // updating postImage field with the S3 object key 
        API.graphql({
          query: updatePost,
          variables: {input: {id: postId, postImage: storageRes.key}},
          authMode: 'AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS'
        }).then(updatedPost => {
          setNewPost({title: '', body: ''});
        });
    });
  });
}
```

Display the image in PostsList

import AmplifyS3Image
```javascript
import {AmplifyS3Image} from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
```
```javascript
function PostsList() {
  ...
  return (
    <>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <div key={post.id}>
          <h3>{post.title}</h3>
          <div>{post.body}</div>
          {post.postImage &&
            <AmplifyS3Image imgKey={post.postImage} />
          }
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```
