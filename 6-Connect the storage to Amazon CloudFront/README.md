# 6. Connect the storage to Amazon CloudFront

As we notice in the previous step, the image loading very slow, and it's not so intuitive to use the Object key of the file.

By connecting the S3 Bucket to Amazon CloudFront we'll get fast distribution for our files and with simple URL link 

[resource](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/1910)

#### Create cloudfront distribution
https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home?region=us-east-1#create-distribution

Select a delivery method for your content > Web > Get started
* Origin Domain Name: my-image-storage...
* Origin Path: /public
* Default Cache Behavior Settings > Viewer Protocol Policy > Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
* Restrict Bucket: Yes
* Origin Access Identity: Create a New Identity
* Grant Read Permissions on Bucket: Yes, Update Bucket Policy
* Get image cdn url

Let's say I upload an image file in the S3 bucket with the key public/my-image-123.jpg, this image will be available through the url https://xxx.cloudfront.net/my-image-123.jpg

#### Refactor the code

We can now save the image URL instead of the S3 Object key in the postImage field 
App.js::CreatePost

From 
````javascript
const onSubmit = e => {
    ...
          API.graphql({
            query: updatePost,
            variables: {input: {id: postId, postImage: storageRes.key}},
            ...
````

Change to
```javascript
const onSubmit = e => {
    ...
          API.graphql({
            query: updatePost,
            variables: {input: {id: postId, postImage: `https://d33ga3e83485t5.cloudfront.net/${storageRes.key}`}},
            ...
```
_Sure we should use env variable for this URL but for this demonstration I'll use hardcoded string_

App.js::PostsList

From
```javascript
function PostsList() {
        ...
          {post.postImage &&
            <AmplifyS3Image imgKey={post.postImage} />
          }
        ...
```

Change To
```javascript
function PostsList() {
        ...
          {post.postImage &&
            <img src={post.postImage} alt={post.title} />
          }
        ...
```
